# 🤖🔊 Voice-Rover — ESP32 Bluetooth Voice-Controlled Robot Car

Voice-Rover is a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) robot car powered by the ESP32 microcontroller and controlled via a **custom-built iOS mobile app**. It enables intuitive bidirectional communication for real-time robot movement using simple text or voice commands.

This project demonstrates a full-stack embedded solution combining **hardware**, **BLE communication**, and a **user-friendly mobile interface**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 **iOS BLE App**
  - Built with React Native & BLE PLX
  - Auto-scans and connects to ESP32
  - Sends control commands and displays ESP32 responses

- 🔁 **Bidirectional BLE Communication**
  - Sends commands like `forward`, `backward`, `stop`, etc.
  - ESP32 confirms received instructions via BLE notifications

- ⚙️ **Motor Control via ESP32**
  - Real-time control of two DC motors using L298N or similar driver
  - Cleanly mapped to basic direction logic

## 🧠 Project Motivation

During development, we noticed a lack of intuitive BLE-based apps on iOS to control ESP32-based devices. We designed our own interface focused on **user experience** and **reliable control**, and integrated it with a robust firmware running on the ESP32.

---

## 📱 App Overview

The iOS app automatically scans for the ESP32 device, connects, and allows users to input or voice-send commands. BLE messages are base64-encoded and decoded to ensure smooth communication.

## 🔧 ESP32 Firmware Highlights

- Sets up BLE server with a custom service/characteristic
- Listens for messages from the app
- Executes movement based on simple string commands:
  - `forward`
  - `backward`
  - `left`
  - `right`
  - `stop`
- Sends acknowledgment messages back to the app

> Firmware is located in `/esp32/BLEWorkingCode.ino`
